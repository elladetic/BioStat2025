# BioStat2025

This repository contains code and materials presented at the Biostatistics Scientific Symposium, demonstrating the application of bootstrap resampling techniques to real-world medical datasets.

# Purpose

The project illustrates how bootstrap methods can be used to:

Estimate standard errors of sample statistics
Compute confidence intervals for linear regression coefficients
Perform hypothesis testing without strict parametric assumptions
These techniques provide robust statistical inference when traditional assumptions (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity) may not hold.

#ï¿½ Medical Data Context

The analysis uses anonymized medical data relevant to common clinical research questions. All examples are chosen to reflect realistic scenarios in epidemiology and healthcare studies.
